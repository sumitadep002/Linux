Zombie Process:

-> A process is zombie process if it has been terminated but in process table it's entry still exists.

-> To overcome this is situation we can use wait() system call should be used to preven parent process from begin executed before child process is terminated.

-> So that parent process will only be executed after termination of child proccess.
