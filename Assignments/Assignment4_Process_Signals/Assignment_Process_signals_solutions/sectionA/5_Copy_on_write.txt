what is copy on write?

->Copy on Write or simply COW is a resource management technique. One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS.

How fork uses it?

->fork() system call creates a duplicate process of parent proc ess which is called as child process.

What is the benefit of using it?

->It will create the copy of a memory page if a process tries to modify the shared memory page so that a modification done by a process will not affect the page which might be accessed by other process.


->In UNIX like OS, fork() system call creates a duplicate process of the parent process which is called as the child process.

The idea behind a copy-on-write is that when a parent process creates a child process then both of these processes initially will share the same pages in memory and these shared pages will be marked as copy-on-write which means that if any of these processes will try to modify the shared pages then only a copy of these pages will be created and the modifications will be done on the copy of pages by that process and thus not affecting the other process.
