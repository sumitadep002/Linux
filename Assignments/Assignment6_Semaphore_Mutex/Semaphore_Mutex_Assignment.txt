1. Explain the concept of concurrency
   -> Need
   -> Benifit
   -> Types
   -> Methods of implementation
   -> Explain concurrency using an example(take some example outside of the reading material provided)

2. Understanding of mutex.
   - Write a program to create two threads. 
   - One thread will write A to Z a file "temp.txt"
   - Other thread will write a to z to the same file "temp.txt"
   - Restriction is, A to Z or a to z should be continuous pattern, whichever is started first.
   - Identify why and where mutex should be used. 
   - If required, protect the critical region.

3. Producer - Consumer program using semaphores
   - A "circular buffer" will be shared among two threads 
         a. Producer thread
         b. Consumer thread
   - Producer thread will write a number/numbers in the circular buffer
   - Consumer should read the number from circular buffer and print it on console
   - Write all numbers from 0 to 1000.
   - Size of "circular buffer" is 16
   - Display exact time taken for the program to execute
   
4. Write the above program using "mutex and conditional variables" instead of "semaphores"

5. What is the difference between semaphore and mutex? Where to use individuals?
