1. Understanding of PIPE. Below program demostrating usage of pipe. 
   - One program will open a pipe, write a number to pipe.                  
   - Other program will open the same pipe, will read the number and print them.
   - Close both the pipes

   - Do the same with two relavent processes.	

2. Producer - Consumer program using threads and semaphore 
   - A queue will be shared among two threads 
         a. Producer thread 
         b. Consumer thread
   - Producer thread will write a number in the queue
   - Consumer should read the number from queue and print it on console only if the queue is not empty.

3. Understanding of shared memory. Below program demostrating usage of shared memory. 
   - One program to write strings to shared memory. 
   - Number of strings and string patterns will be given by user from command line.
   - Second program should read the number of strings and string patterns from shared memory region.
   - Strings should be reversed and stored to at the same location.
   - In both the programs, memory addresses should be printed where the strings are stored.

4. Describe Named FIFO and Unnamed FIFO.
    Write a program to copy data from file1 to file2 through named FIFO.
    Program done with two relavent processes and unrelavent processes.
    Example:
    my_cpy file1.txt file2.txt #This command will copy content of file1.txt to file2.txt.

5. Write a program to copy string from one process to another using unnamed pipe.

6. Write a program to copy structure of your name, address, phone no from one process to another process using named pipe.

7. Write a program to allow two way communication between process using shared memory.

8. Implement message queue communication method between child and parent.
